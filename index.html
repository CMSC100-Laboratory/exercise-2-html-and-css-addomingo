                    <p class="autobiography">
                        <span class="highlight">Arianna Judelle D. Domingo</span> was born on May 26, 2004, and was raised in her hometown located in Bacoor, Cavite.
                         Throughout her childhood, she mostly focused on her academics and had few hobbies.
                         <br><br>
                         This cycle of monotony was disrupted by the end of elementary school, when her friend introduced her to the world of art.
                         Since then, her hobbies revolved around art and handicrafts.
                         <br><br>
                         Originally supposed to take up a degree program much more related to art, such as architecture, Arianna eventually chose to take BS Computer Science in the 
                         University of the Philippines Los Baños. This was because she was in awe by the interface of a certain website, which inspired her to strive to make visually
                         appealing websites of her own aesthetic.
                         <br><br>
                         Arianna loves the color Blue, and tends to favor minimalistic and elegant designs. 
                         However, she is always eager to broaden her area of creativity and explore other varieties of design.
