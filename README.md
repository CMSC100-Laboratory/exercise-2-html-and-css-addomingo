## Key Takeaways

For me, it was better to use CSS externally and keep HTML and CSS files separated. This makes the code organized and not convoluted, enabling others to understand what the code does just by reading it. Moreover, I understood that it is important to use flexbox to make the page responsive, thereby increasing the flexibility of a website when viewed on different screens.


## Challenges encountered

It was hard to manipulate the elements to how I wanted to present them. I especially struggled with stacking elements while still making them responsive. Hence, some elements act abnormally when the screen size is adjusted.
